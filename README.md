# sorting_algorithm_practice

An analysis of various sorting algorithms in C++.

A CSV database of video games were converted into C++ objects, which were then sorted using Bubble, Insertion, Quick, Heap, and Two Sorts.

The time that each sort took to sort 100 items was recorded and analyzed in the pdf.

This project was created using JetBrains CLion. To run this program you can clone this repo to CLion and run it from there, otherwise you will have to download the CMake program in order to compile and run the binaries.
